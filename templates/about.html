            <p style="text-align:justify;"> A phone number verification (or validation) services are online services used to establish whether a given phone number is in service or not . They may include a form of Turing test to further determine if a human answers by using any of the answering equipment such as a modem, fax, voice Mail</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">phone numbers in India have ten digits (excluding an initial zero which is required at times) and fall into at least four distinct categories:

                Toll Free: These are usually ten digit numbers beginning with 1-800. Sometimes they are accessible (or are toll-free) only when called from the government-owned telephone corporation, BSNL/MTNL.
                Service numbers: These are usually three or four digit numbers (e.g. Police is 100) used to access an emergency service (Fire, Ambulance, Police, Roadside assistance) or a value-added service.</p>
                <p>Phone number authentication is a security process used to verify a user's identity by associating their phone number with an account or service. Hereâ€™s how it generally works:

                    User Input: The user provides their phone number to the service or application.
                    Verification Code: The service sends a verification code (usually a one-time password or OTP) to the provided phone number via SMS or voice call.
                    Code Entry: The user enters the received code into the application or website.
                    Validation: The service validates the code. If it matches the code sent, the phone number is confirmed as belonging to the user.
                    This method is commonly used for account creation, password recovery, and two-factor authentication (2FA) to enhance security.
